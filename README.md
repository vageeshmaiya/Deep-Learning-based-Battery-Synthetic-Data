# Darts

## Get started
1. This project has been executed in Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab.
2. The code for different models are availabe in the models folder.
3. To run the code directly in colab open the ipynb folders of the required model.
4. Deep_tcn: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vageeshmaiya/Deep-Learning-based-Battery-Synthetic-Data/blob/main/Deep_tcn.ipynb)
5. Deep_AR: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vageeshmaiya/Deep-Learning-based-Battery-Synthetic-Data/blob/main/Deep_AR.ipynb)
